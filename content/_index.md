## Want to learn how to design chips?

Learn to design and fabricate your own [ASIC](/terminology/asic)! Thanks to the new Open Source [Process Development Kit](/terminology/pdk) from Google and Skywater along with the OpenLane ASIC tools from [Efabless](https://efabless.com/).

GCC revolutionised compiling, Linux revolutionised computing. Android revolutionised phones. Arduino revolutionised microcontrollers. RISCV is revolutionising ISAs. The next step is Open Source Silicon.

This course will give you the experience of creating your own microchip, using free and open source tools.

25 people who have taken the course in the last year have have [already submitted designs for MPW2](/post/mpw2-submitted/) and [MPW3](/post/mpw3).

## FAQ

#### Can I get a refund?

I'm so confident you will love the course, if for any reason you are unhappy you can ask for a refund within 30 days of purchase.

[Back to top](#tickets)

#### How big can I make my custom project? {#how-big}

Your project needs to be 300 x 300 um. See the [MPW2 submission](/post/mpw2-submitted/) for ideas about what is possible in this space.
If you need bigger then you can make an individual application to Efabless.

[Back to top](#tickets)

#### Will I definitely get an ASIC with my design on it? {#asic-def}

Chips are only guaranteed on the Arsenic level ticket. Boron and Silicon tickets are entered into the Google/Skywater free shuttle.

The free shuttle is currently run as a lottery and while we have a good chance of getting in there is no guarantee.

You are able to make your own application separately to the group if you wish.

If the application doesn’t make it onto the shuttle, then that also means we don’t get the decapped photos.

[Back to top](#tickets)

#### How long does the whole course take to complete?

It depends on your existing level of experience and how deep you want to go on your own project. Most people complete each section in 4 hours, so about 20 hours for coursework.
Then you will need some amount of time to prepare your own project.

[Back to top](#tickets)

#### Is there a time limit to complete the course?

You can take as long as you want with the course materials.

[Back to top](#tickets)

#### When do I need to submit my final design?

It depends on the next shuttle. As we don't know this in advance I will announce this through discord and email. If you want to submit to the group project I will give you a deadline of 2 weeks
before the shuttle closing date to make sure I have enough time to aggregate all the designs into a single submissions.

[Back to top](#tickets)

#### Do I need an FPGA to develop my design? {#fpga}

For simple and small designs like the ones I include in the course, you can use simulation to check everything is working fine. If you want to make a more complex project, then it’s probably a good idea to test your design on an FPGA.

[Back to top](#tickets)

#### What is the life of the course? {#course-life}

For as long as I'm running this course.

[Back to top](#tickets)

#### What is team access? {#team-access}

Take the course with 2 colleagues. You will work through the course material as a group and submit a single design between you.
