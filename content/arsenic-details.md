There are some more details you should be aware of before buying an Arsenic ticket:

* To run this level of ticket, I need 4 participants in order to make the ChipIgnite order via Efabless.
* If not enough tickets are sold then I will refund you the difference between this ticket and the number of Boron level tickets for each person in your team.
* While your design doesn't need to be open source, you should be aware that as I am aggregating 4 designs into the 1 chip, the other participants will have your die. Theoretically they could reverse-engineer your design. Having said that, it wouldn't be any easier than reverse engineering any other ASIC.
* While I will make my best attempt to make sure all the designs are working, I can't offer any guarantees that your chips will function.

If you have any questions, please [get in touch here](/contact-form).
