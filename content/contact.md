I am working on a course. The specs are not final but this is the rough idea.

# 0 to ASIC workshop

Design and fabricate your own [ASIC](/terminology/asic)! Thanks to the new Open Source [Process Development Kit](/terminology/pdk) from Google and Skywater along with the latest Open Source ASIC tools from [Efabless](https://efabless.com/).

GCC revolutionised compiling, Linux revolutionised computing. Arduino revolutionised microcontrollers. RISCV is revolutionising ISAs. The next step is Open Source Silicon. 

This workshop will allow the opportunity for people to experience creating their own microchips, using free and Open Source tools. We will concentrate on digital design.

# Learning overview

* Learn how [MOSFETs](/terminology/mosfet) are used to create your design in silicon
* Learn the basics of digital design with [Verilog](/terminology/hdl)
* [Simulate](/terminology/simulation) and Formally [verify](/terminology/verification) your design
* Use the [OpenLane ASIC flow](/terminology/openlane) to create the files necessary for the factory
* [Aggregate the designs](/post/multi-project-harness) together and submit to the Google/Skywater [shuttle](/terminology/shuttle)
* Celebrate! (a successful chip is not guaranteed!)

# Format

* 12 hours of self guided labs
* support via discord server
* mostly asynchronous - do in your own time
* weekly office hours to discuss progress and problems
* a PCB will be available with ASIC presoldered for you
* a high resolution set of images of the decapped ASIC

# Prerequisites

* Basic command line experience helpful
* Some basic electronics experience helpful
* Some Linux exposure helpful

# Costs

* about $500
