# Want to learn to make your own chips?

Learn to design and fabricate your own [ASIC](/terminology/asic)! Thanks to the new Open Source [Process Development Kit](/terminology/pdk) from Google and Skywater along with the OpenLANE ASIC tools from [Efabless](https://efabless.com/).

GCC revolutionised compiling, Linux revolutionised computing. Arduino revolutionised microcontrollers. RISCV is revolutionising ISAs. The next step is Open Source Silicon. 

This course will give you the experience creating your own microchip, using free and Open Source tools. 

14 people who took the course in the last 6 months have [already submitted designs for MPW2](/post/mpw2-submitted/).

# What do people say about the course?

{{< youtube fjpFWogQl8Y >}}

> The Zero To ASIC course took me on a fantastic journey from drawing
   and simulating a MOSFET, formal verification leading up to
     implementing a custom design with an open PDK and completely open
       source tools.  The course is crammed full of interesting material with
         great pacing and support from Matt, and it's been a fantastic
           opportunity to meet other folks with shared interests and different
             backgrounds.  The course has left me excited with opportunities for
               new projects and optimism for some working silicon!

# Course Overview

* We will concentrate on digital design.
* A virtual machine is available or you can install the tools manually. 
* The course is continually updated for the latest tooling and PDK.
* [Full course details here](/course_content).
* Find out more about [Matt's science communication work here](http://sci-com.mattvenn.net).

* 11 hands-on projects, supported with text guides and over 6 hours of videos.
* Support via:
    * discord community server.
    * weekly course hangout call.
    * 1 to 1 office hours with Matt: access to expert help on the Boron and Arsenic level tickets.
* Asynchronous - do in your own time.
* A PCB will be optionally available to buy with ASIC pre-soldered for you - see [FAQ](#faq).
* High resolution set of digital images of the decapped ASIC - see [FAQ](#faq).
* Access to the course materials for the lifetime of the course.
* Course completion certificate.

# FAQ

Q. Refunds?

If for any reason you are unhappy with the course you can ask for a refund.

Q. Will I definitely get an ASIC with my design on it?

No, an ASIC is not guaranteed unless you have an Arsenic ticket. 
To keep the cost of the course reasonable we have to rely on the Google/Skywater free shuttle. The shuttle is currently run as a lottery and while we have a good chance of getting in there is no guarantee. You are able to make your own application separately to the group if you wish.

If the application doesn’t make it onto the shuttle, then that also means we don’t get the decapped photos.

Q. How big can I make my custom project?

Your project needs to be 300 x 300 um. See the [MPW2 submission](/post/mpw2-submitted/) for ideas about what is possible in this space.
If you need bigger then you can make an individual application to Efabless.

Q. How long does the whole course take to complete?

It depends on your existing level of experience and how deep you want to go on your own project. Most people complete each section in 4 hours, so about 20 hours for coursework. 
Then you will need some amount of time to prepare your own project.

Q. Is there a time limit to complete the course?

You can take as long as you want with the course materials.

Q. When do I need to submit my final design?

It depends on the next shuttle. As we don't know this in advance I will check with you at the end of the course. If you want to submit to the group project I will give you a deadline of 2 weeks
before the shuttle closing date to make sure I have enough time to aggregate all the designs into a single submissions.

Q. Do I need an FPGA to develop my design?

For simple and small designs like the ones I include in the course, you can use simulation to check everything is working fine. If you want to make a more complex project, then it’s probably a good idea to test your design on an FPGA.
