## Who are the experts?

Tnt is well known in the open source FPGA community, and one of his most recent & impressive demonstrations of his mastery was [running doom on an ICE40 FPGA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZBAZ5QoCAk). He also taped out an [open source USB stack on MPW1](/post/interview-with-tnt/).

Whitequark has been involved with the open source EDA tools since their foundation, and has made many contributions to the toolchain, as well as Amaranth - a high level design language. Recently she designed the [Glasgow interface explorer](https://www.crowdsupply.com/1bitsquared/glasgow) and posted a [great thread on digital design over on twitter](https://twitter.com/whitequark/status/1510525555191558150).

## Structure

The call will be in the form of a private Youtube livestream.

### Quick questions: 15 mins

Participants submit questions in advance. On the stream we will get through as many as we can.
There may be time on the call for new questions that werenâ€™t submitted beforehand, otherwise will go on the list for next time.

### Deeper dive: 35 mins

Participants can submit their design for review, or a larger question. On the call we will look at 1 or 2.

### Tip of the week: 5 mins

Expert will present their tip of the week for digital design, tooling, methodology, books, resources etc.

## Pricing

Pricing is challenging to get right, as depending on your financial situation, $240 may sound totally reasonable or out of the question.
I am trying an experiment with the pricing for this call to make it more accessible.

If you can, please pay full price for the call. If not, then I have 2 sets of discount codes:

* 4 codes that give a $160 discount. Use code DIGI160,
* 6 codes that give a $80 discount. Use code DIGI80,
* Please only use the codes if you are unable to pay the full price.
