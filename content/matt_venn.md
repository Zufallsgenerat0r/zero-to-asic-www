> "Matt Venn's Zero To ASIC course is a real eye-opener to the possibilities of open source hardware.  The course itself is a tour-de-force overview of almost all aspects of ASIC development from concept to GDSII.  It's also great fun and regardless of your background or previous experience, you'll learn a lot and have a great deal of fun doing it.  This course has inspired me to take the next step and submit my own design to efabless." Mike Thompson
