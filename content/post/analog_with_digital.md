Harald Pretl made a fascinating submission to Tiny Tapeout 3, an analog circuit made from digital standard cells.

It builds a DAC out of a lot of tristate inverters, and a big capacitor by ganging up a lot of NAND gates.

In this interview with Harald we discuss how it works and how he made it and simulated it.
