Proppy has been doing some great work with preparing the open source ASIC tools to work inside Jupyter notebooks.
This means that you can now experiment with simulation and ASIC hardening without needing to download or configure the tools.

I think this is going to be of great importance for academia and education:

* Now when people publish papers they can include a link to a notebook that reproduces the published results.
* For education, it's going to be so much easier to do a class workshop without having to install tools or maintain VMs.

Proppy demonstrated and explained his work in this interview.

His work has already been used by [Teo, who has been using the notebooks to measure the PPA](/post/interview-with-teo) of various types of hardware adder optimisations.

You can play with the notebooks yourself here: https://github.com/chipsalliance/silicon-notebooks.
