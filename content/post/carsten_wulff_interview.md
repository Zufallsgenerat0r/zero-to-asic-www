In this insightful interview, I talk with Carsten Wulff, Principal IC Scientist at Nordic Semiconductor, about all things analog ASIC design.

Carsten kicks things off by sharing a fascinating anecdote about how he ended up designing an analog SAR during his winter holiday in the Norwegian mountains, sparked by the opportunity to include analog designs on Tiny Tapeout 6.

The conversation then shifts to Carsten’s thoughts on the accessibility of 130nm technology for analog design, which he believes is "the last comfortable node". While larger designs with millions of digital gates might not be suitable, 130nm shines for analog applications, offering a sweet spot between performance and cost-effectiveness.

As the interview progresses, Carsten shares valuable insights from his extensive experience in the field. He recounts an early career experience where a mysterious gain error in an ADC left his team baffled. It was only through a stroke of luck, accidentally pushing in the PCB, that they stumbled upon the root cause – highlighting the unpredictable nature of analog debugging.

This interview provides a glimpse into the world of analog ASIC design through the eyes of a seasoned expert. Carsten’s passion for the field is evident, and his insights offer valuable takeaways for anyone interested in exploring the world of analog and mixed-signal ASICs.
