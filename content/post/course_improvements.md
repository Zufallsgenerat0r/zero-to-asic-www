After 6 months, 90 participants and [14 designs submitted to MPW2](/post/mpw2-submitted), I'm making the Zero to ASIC course even better!

One of the things that's great about the course is that you can proceed at your own pace. I originally set the course length at 6 weeks, but a lot of people want more time than this. To resolve this I have:

* removed the expiry date on the discord support,
* removed the expiry date on office hours.

To help grow the community and provide another venue for discussing the course, I have added a weekly group call for anyone on the course to join. It's been going really well; we answer questions, discuss the course and chat about what's going on in the world of open source ASICs.

I've also added a new ticket level with team access & guaranteed chips via [Efabless' ChipIgnite program](https://efabless.com/chipignite).

Another improvement is to move away from starting the courses in groups. People naturally drift apart as they work through the material, so I am trying a few new things:

* tickets are now on sale direct from this website,
* you can start whenever you want,
* discord channels to support each part of the course rather than each group.
