The [Free Silicon Conference](https://wiki.f-si.org/index.php/FSiC2023) returned to Paris in 2023. There were plenty of great talks and I really enjoyed the conference.
I was able to interview the organiser and several speakers:

* Luca Alloatti - organiser
* Thomas Benz - [PULP](https://pulp-platform.org/index.html)
* JÃ¸rgen Kragh Jakobsen - his work on open source silicon in Denmark
* Thomas Parry - startup founder of [Spherical Systems](https://spherical-systems.com/)
* Rene Scholz - Open source PDK from IHP Microsystems
* Dan Fritchman - Analog tools
* Harald Pretl - Mixed signal design
