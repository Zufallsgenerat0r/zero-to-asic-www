In my recent video [Getting started with open source ASICs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSFUd7S2otE), I provided an overview of the open-source silicon movement, highlighting key resources and tools while showcasing some inspiring projects.

The video starts by looking back at the game-changing moment in 2020 when Google, Tim Ansell, and [Efabless](https://efabless.com) announced their free shuttle program, making it possible for anyone to get their open-source chip designs manufactured. This sparked a wave of innovation, with many taking their first steps in ASIC design using open-source tools like OpenLane and the Skywater 130nm PDK.

I then walk through the evolution of my own journey, starting with my first chip design in 2020, a [VGA clock](/post/vga_clock) that I've since taped out multiple times, pushing the boundaries of complexity and collaboration with each iteration.

The video then shifts to the vibrant open-source silicon community. With thousands of members on the [Open Source Silicon Slack channel](https://join.skywater.tools/), the community provides a supportive environment for sharing knowledge, collaborating on projects, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible. This collaborative spirit is a key strength of the movement, breaking down the traditional silos of the semiconductor industry.

Of course, no introduction to open-source ASIC design would be complete without a look at the tools. I provide an overview of the most popular tools, including [OpenLane](/terminology/openlane), OpenLane 2, and Silicon Compiler, all of which are freely available and can be used to design chips from start to finish. I also highlight some of the challenges and areas for improvement, such as the need for more robust verification tools, better support for analog and mixed-signal design, and continued development of open-source IP libraries.

To make it easier for newcomers to experience the thrill of designing and manufacturing their own chips, I introduce [Tiny Tapeout](https://tinytapeout.com), a project that allows multiple designers to share the cost of a chip fabrication run. Tiny Tapeout offers a low-cost, low-risk way to get your designs manufactured, making it ideal for students, hobbyists, and professionals alike.

I conclude the presentation by showcasing a diverse range of projects built using open-source tools, from a microcoded USB peripheral and a 5 GHz satellite transceiver to a RISC-V CPU and an AI accelerator. These projects demonstrate the potential of open-source ASIC design and hint at the exciting possibilities that lie ahead.

Whether you're a seasoned engineer or a curious beginner, I encourage you to check out the video and explore the world of open-source silicon. With the right tools, resources, and a collaborative spirit, the possibilities are limitless.

If you want a helping hand, consider my highly regarded [digital](/) and [analog](/analog) courses.
