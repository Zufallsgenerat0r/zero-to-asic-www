An exciting new opportunity for developing open-source silicon reached fruition at the end of 2022!

[GlobalFoundries (GF)](https://gf.com/) teamed up with Google to fund open-source projects using GF's [foundry](/terminology/foundry) and their open-source 180 nm [PDK](/terminology/pdk) [GF180](https://github.com/google/gf180mcu-pdk).

Open-source PDKs like GF180 and [Skywater 130 nm](https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk) are essential for making silicon design more accessible. To now have GlobalFoundries involved with fabricating designs will hopefully mean increased opportunities to turn designs into silicon.

GF180's first [multi-project wafer (MPW) tapeout](/terminology/tapeout) was in December 2022, and several people from the Zero to ASIC and TinyTapeout communities were able to submit designs. Here are some highlights:
* [TinyUserProject](/post/tinyuserproject/) enabling quick and easy submissions to the [Open MPW shuttles](https://developers.google.com/silicon),
* [TinyTapeout design](https://tinytapeout.com/digital_design/design_7seg/) that outputs "TinyTapeout" sequentially on a 7-segment display ([@mattvenn](https://twitter.com/matthewvenn)),
* [Test structures](https://platform.efabless.com/projects/1559) like D-triggers with and without set/reset, designed using [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/339800239192932947) ([Shaos](https://github.com/shaos))
* [SkullFET GF180](https://platform.efabless.com/projects/1580) implementing *barebones* transistors shaped like skulls ([@urishaked](https://twitter.com/UriShaked))

You can look through other submissions on the [Efabless Projects Page](https://platform.efabless.com/projects/public). 

If you're curious to learn more about the GF180 PDK, check out the [interview with Prof. James Stine](/post/interview-with-james-stine/), who is an active contributor of [standard cells](/terminology/standardcell) to the PDK.
