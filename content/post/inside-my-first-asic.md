I got a once in a lifetime chance to use a particle accelerator to look inside my first [ASIC](/post/asic_submitted)! 

It was amazing to be able to see all the different layers and match them up with the design files I sent to [Efabless](https://efabless.com/).

So join me on my journey to the Swiss Light Source at the [Paul Scherrer Institut](https://www.psi.ch/en/sls)
where I learnt how they use their synchrotron to make some awesome images!

I also have a [public photo album](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNJOEhlY9GbbxQlACOMBE-JakFZIJEhXrw1paUwFGSxZOnYOA4UQNP6G2Z9YPNMAQ?key=blI4ZmdpVWdUUnUyQ2tZRUVqb0J4SEROaVljeHpR) if you want some SLS themed wallpaper!

And if you want more details on how the process works, I did an interview with Tomas Aidukas here:
