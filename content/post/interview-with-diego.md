In this interview I talk with [Diego Hernando](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diego-joaqu%C3%ADn-hernando-196a2715b/) about their ASIC submission.

They have been working on some analog blocks; mostly op-amps but also including a [PLL from another designer](https://github.com/lakshmi-sathi/caravel_avsdpll1v8).

We discuss the difference between digital and analog design, the tools, simulation, layout and testing.

Here's the [link to the repository](https://github.com/diegohernando/caravel_fulgor_opamp)
