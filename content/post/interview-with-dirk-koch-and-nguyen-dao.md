One of the popular types of entries to MPW1 & 2 have been FPGAs. 
I have previously spoken with [Arya Reais-Parsi](/post/interview-with-arya) about their FPGA project submitted to MPW1.

In MPW2 I noticed there were a couple of applications that seemed fairly advanced - especially FuseRISC: 2 RISCV processors with embedded FPGA fabric between them.

Dirk & Nguyen kindly allowed me to interview them about:

* their FABulous eFPGA framework,
* support for Yosys & NextPNR,
* parameterisation of the fabric, 
* blockrams with OpenRAM,
* their MPW applications and previous tape-outs, and
* their experience with the open source tools. 

Enjoy!
