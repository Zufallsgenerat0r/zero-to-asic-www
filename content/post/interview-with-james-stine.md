In this interview with Professor James Stine, we talk about:

* Why Open Source is the key to innovation
* What do students struggle with most when learning to design standard cell libraries?
* What are the biggest misconceptions engineers have about standard cells?
* Whatâ€™s James' tool flow?
* How many cells are needed to make a library?
* Why do we need another library for Global Foundries (GF) 180?
* How far are open source tools from commercial tools?
* Could automated layout of standard cells compete with hand layouts in nanometer processes?
* With Moore's Law slowing down, do any circuit families deserve a second chance?
* Why would nVidia make a 7.5T standard cell library?
