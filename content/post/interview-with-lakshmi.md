In this interview I talk with Lakshmi S about their shuttle submission.

As well as convering what a PLL is and its component parts, we also answered some interesting questions from the twitter community:

* how long things take to design, what is fun and what is frustrating,
* how to change the PLL's response,
* why design a integrated loop filter,
* process corners and ngspice
* post silicon testing.

The repository is [here](https://github.com/lakshmi-sathi/avsdpll_1v8).

They combined their design with [Deigo Hernando](/post/interview-with-diego)
