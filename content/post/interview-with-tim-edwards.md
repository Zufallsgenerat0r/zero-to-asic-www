In this interview I talk with Tim Edwards from eFabless. He is their vice president of analog and platform.

We mostly talked about what needs to happen before they send the final files to Skywater. 

A lot of the work is infrastructure:

* fetching files, 
* compositing IDs,
* generating fill layers,
* a final [DRC](/terminology/DRC) run.
