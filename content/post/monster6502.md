I had the chance to interview [Eric Schlaepfer](https://twitter.com/TubeTimeUS) about his MOnSter 6502, a 6502 processor made out of discrete transistors.
For me, one of the most interesting things about this project are the similarities to ASIC design, for example Eric wrote his own [LVS](/terminology/lvs) tool.
