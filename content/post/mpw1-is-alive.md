Yes! I have got all the designs I submitted to MPW1 working:

* ✅ 7 segment display
* ✅ TPM2137 CTF
* ✅ WS2812 led driver
* ✅ VGA clock
* ✅ Multiplexor

I put together a video to demonstrate them all:

The 4 other designs that were [part of this submission](/post/mpw1_submitted) were made by friends who I've now sent samples to. It's looking likely that everyone's designs will work.

## Bringup 

You can read more about the [bringup process here](/post/mpw1-bringup), and see the repository with firmware here:

Sylvain 'tnt' Munaut is working on a more in-depth video describing his methodology, so subscribe to his [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/SylvainMunaut) to learn more.

## TPM2137 CTF

Q3K made the [TPM2137 CTF](https://github.com/mattvenn/TPM2137/) for [Dragon Sector](https://dragonsector.pl/). I solved it with formal verification tools and taped it out on MPW1. 
My challenge to reverse engineer the password from the [GDS](/terminology/gds) was quickly completed by Geo, who put up their solution here:

Congratulations Geo!
