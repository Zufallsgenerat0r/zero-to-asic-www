Efabless have announced MPW2! The closing date is the 18th of June.

The biggest changes are:

* OpenLANE ASIC flow updated to rc0.15
* Caravel has become [caravel_user_project](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_user_project) at the mpw-two-c tag:
    * smaller repo size includes a 'Caravel Lite' submodule
    * new IRQ ports
    * logic analyser registers renamed
* An alternative analogue specific 'Caravan' harness
* The submission process has been streamlined to make it faster and easier to submit

You can browse the current applications here: https://efabless.com/open_shuttle_program/2.

I have already made an application for people on the course here: https://efabless.com/projects/66. This will be updated as I receive
more designs from the course.

The Zero to ASIC Course material has been updated, and I have expanded part 5 to include dedicated projects for personal and group submissions.

You can see the walkthrough video from Efabless here:

And they have also announced a paid version of the service! $10k for 250 chips makes for $40 samples!
