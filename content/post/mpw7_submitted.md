We submitted for MPW7! I am particularly excited about this submission because we were able to submit the Zero to ASIC course designs as well as the first [Tiny Tapeout](https://mailchi.mp/574276e3c9d7/tinytapeout) design. 

MPW7 has by far had the most submissions of the MPW shuttles so far with 72 submitted projects as of 13 September.

Congratulations to everyone on the course submission! We had 9 projects from the course, with 1 demo arbitrary function generator from me, a 32-bit RISC-V based processor by Farhad, an in silicon version of [Conwayâ€™s Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) from Uri and a [Spiking Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiking_neural_network) (SNN) accelerator by Peng Zhou. We also implemented 1kByte of RAM with open-source [OpenRAM](https://openram.org/).

Here's the [github repo for the group submission](https://github.com/mattvenn/zero_to_asic_mpw7) and the [Efabless project](https://platform.efabless.com/projects/1180).

Curious about Tiny Tapeout? Check out the [github repo](https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout-mpw7) and the [Efabless project](https://platform.efabless.com/projects/1229).

And here's a list of the projects - congratulations again everyone!
