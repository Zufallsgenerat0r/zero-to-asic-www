We submitted for MPW8! Special congratulations to Adrian Wong for the course submission! 

We still managed to get 4 projects in the submission...not bad for a deadline of New Year's Eve.

The projects include a partial implementation of an L1 GPS tracking channel by Adrian Wong, a *Simon Says* game implementated by Uri Shaked, and 2 demo submissions (frequency counter and RGB mixer) from me.
