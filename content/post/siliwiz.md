# Aims

*   Draw your own logic gate and understand how that gate would be manufactured in a [foundry](/terminology/foundry/).
*   Learn how the gate is built out of the fundamental circuit elements used in chip design
*   Understand how the drawings are used to manufacture the chip
*   Be aware of some of SiliWizâ€™s limitations and simplifications

# Lessons

We have a set of free lessons that guide you through from drawing and simulating resistors all the way up to a [CMOS](/terminology/cmos) inverter.
