In the words of one of our first time submitters "Just yesterday, I was dreaming of a tapeout cooperative, and it turns out to exist. Thanks to you all!! Looking forward to TT05!"

Thanks to everyone who submitted and all the contributors. Also a huge thanks to [Efabless Corporation](https://efabless.com/) for sponsoring the project!

Tiny Tapeout 5 is already open and will close in early November 2023.
