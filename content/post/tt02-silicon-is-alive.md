We submitted [Tiny Tapeout 2](/post/tinytapeout02) back in December, and last week I received the chips from [Efabless](https://efabless.com/).

Most first chip designs fail, but you never hear about it because the big companies keep it a secret. So we thought - why not do the worldâ€™s first public silicon bring up?

Thankfully the chips worked, and you can watch the whole stream here.

We've since [found 1 errata](https://github.com/TinyTapeout/tinytapeout-02/issues/10), but luckily not a show stopper.

I had a lot of fun working through the datasheet and picking designs to test. Here's a video of me showing off the following designs:

And here's links to those designs:

* random number generator https://tinytapeout.com/runs/tt02/086
* worm in a maze https://tinytapeout.com/runs/tt02/084
* M0 subleq https://tinytapeout.com/runs/tt02/039
* Pi 1000 places https://tinytapeout.com/runs/tt02/036
* dice roll https://tinytapeout.com/runs/tt02/061
* breathing led https://tinytapeout.com/runs/tt02/068/
* lcd namebadge https://tinytapeout.com/runs/tt02/056

We're looking forward to getting the boards manufactured at [Aisler](https://aisler.net/) and getting them sent out to the 165 people who submitted designs!
