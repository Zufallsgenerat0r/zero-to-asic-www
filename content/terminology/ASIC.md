Application Specific Integrated Circuit

An ASIC is a custom [IC](/terminology/IC). 
Typically big semiconductor companies produce millions of chips, which offsets the large costs related to the [masks](./terminology/maskset).
An Application Specific IC is something you design when you need a chip that isn't available off-the-shelf.

Here's a picture from [magic](/terminology/magic) showing a layout of my [VGA clock](/post/vga_clock)

And a zoom, more clearly showing the [standard cells](/terminology/standardcell)
