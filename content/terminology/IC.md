An Integrated Circuit is a collection of circuit elements all together on one piece of silicon.
Example elements include:

* transistors, for example [MOSFETS](/terminology/mosfet)
* resistors
* capacitors
* inductors

Here is an example of a fairly small IC, a type of amplifier called an Op-Amp.

From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invention_of_the_integrated_circuit): There is no consensus on who invented the IC. The American press of the 1960s named four people: Kilby, Lehovec, Noyce and Hoerni; in the 1970s the list was shortened to Kilby and Noyce.
