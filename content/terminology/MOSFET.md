A MOSFET is a type of transistor we can use as a digital switch.
The name stands for Metal Oxide Silicon Field Effect Transistor.
The first MOSFET was made in 1959 by Mohamed M. Atalla & Dawon Kahng.

* Easy to manufacture in volume
* Easy to change its size
* It is the basic building block of modern electronics

They are the most manufactured object worldwide: 1.3Ã—10^22 of them have been made between 1960 and 2018 - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSFET)

# Operation

You can see the gate and body connections as the 2 sides of a capacitor. 
When an electric field is applied by charging the gate, the electro-chemistry of the
channel region will change and allow current to flow between the source and the drain.
