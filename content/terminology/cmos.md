https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMOS:

> Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) is a type of [MOSFET](/terminology/mosfet) fabrication [process](/terminology/node) that uses complementary and symmetrical pairs of p-type and n-type MOSFETs to build logic functions. 

It is low powered compared to [NMOS](/terminology/nmos).

Here is a CMOS inverter showing the complementary N and P type MOSFETs.

And here's how it could be laid out using a tool like [Magic](/terminology/magic)
