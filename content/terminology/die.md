The silicon [wafer](/terminology/wafer) is usually patterned with the [mask set](/terminology/maskset) to make hundreds or thousands of the same [IC](/terminology/ic).

Each of these ICs are then cut out of the wafer and are called dies.

The die is then somehow packaged. Often they are mounted to a leadframe and then moulded into a plastic packaging to make them larger and easier to handle.

The Google [shuttle](/terminology/shuttle) will provide a type of packaging called [Wafer Level Chip Scale Packaging](/terminology/wlcsp).
