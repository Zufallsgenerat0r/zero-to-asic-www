We need to make sure we can package the [IC](/terminology/ic) after the [wafer](/terminology/wafer) has been diced into individual [dies](/terminology/die).

A common way of packaging ICs is to connect them to a [leadframe](/terminology/die#leadframe) by bonding tiny wires between the leads of the leadframe and the pads on the die.

The big bond pads around the outside of the IC often include [ESD protection diodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic_discharge), Input/Output drivers and so on.

This picture shows _raven_, an IC from Efabless. You can see around the edge there are the big bond pads and the power and ground lines. This structure is called a padring.

The padring used in the [Google shuttle is included in Caravel](/terminology/shuttle#caravel).
