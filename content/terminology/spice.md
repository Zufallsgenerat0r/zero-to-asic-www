SPICE is a general-purpose, open-source analog electronic circuit simulator. It stands for Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis.
ngspice is a successor, and is easily installable on Linux. It's the simulator I've used to explore the Skywater 130 [PDK](/terminology/pdk).

Here's an [example spice simulation file](https://github.com/mattvenn/magic-inverter/blob/main/simulation.spice) that I used to [simulate the inverter I drew](/post/inverter).

And here's a nice demo of me showing how a flip-flop works by simulating a Sky130 D type flip flop with SPICE.
