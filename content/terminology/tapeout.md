Once a chip design is complete, it is taped out for manufacturing. 
This means sending the [GDS2](/terminology/gds2) files to the [foundry](/terminology/foundry).

The term "tape out" was coined in 70's.
Historically, the ASIC design files were stored on magnetic tape.
The event of carrying out the tape to the [foundry](/terminology/foundry) was thus called "tape out".
