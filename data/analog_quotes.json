The comprehensive curriculum covers everything from schematic capture to GDS file generation, offering a deep understanding of the entire design process, along with plenty of debugging opportunities. I highly recommend that every Analog Design Engineer acquire these skills to become a full-stack developer in this complex yet fascinating field."

The Discord channel and weekly calls are where I can ask questions and stay up to date with what is happening in the community. I am very glad to be a part of it and have submitted digital and mixed-signal designs."
