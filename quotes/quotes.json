You're not really going to know what you're going to get out of it. And you're not going to know if what you've actually done is correct, so having an option to take a course with some other people has been a really great way of learning it."

The course is crammed full of interesting material with great pacing and support from Matt, and it's been a fantastic opportunity to meet other folks with shared interests and different backgrounds. The course has left me excited with opportunities for new projects and optimism for some working silicon!"

It offers the glimpse at the superpower too - seeing the traces of the original design in what used to be just squiggly lines of the masks before. Plus, I am getting my own piece of a silicon ðŸ™‚"

The course itself is a tour-de-force overview of almost all aspects of ASIC development from concept to GDSII.  It's also great fun and regardless of your background or previous experience, you'll learn a lot and have a great deal of fun doing it.  This course has inspired me to take the next step and submit my own design to efabless."

Itâ€™s been a fascination since grad school at least, so I've been interested in seeing more open source alternatives crop up, and now with the skywater PDK and OpenLane it seemed like the right time. Itâ€™s still a bit hard to get the motivation to get started, it feels like a bit of a hurdle so when I saw this course I just jumped right on it. It felt like a perfect way to get started."
